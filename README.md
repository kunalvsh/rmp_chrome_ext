## Rate My Professors USC Chrome Extension

A very basic, somewhat-working version of the RMP USC Chrome extension. It's a work in progress!

##Searching Up Professors

Right now, highlight the professor's last name and right click the highlighted text. Select "Search RMP for Selected Text". The extension will open a tab for you, showing you the professors that go to USC with the last name you selected.

##To-Do

+Add functionality to go directly to professor's page rather than search page
+Add functionality for error popup if professor does not exist
+Add functionality for other schools
